# MultiEmu
Was a gaming emulator frontend that was not finished.  Had some interesting elements: Joystick handling in Swing, Transparency effects, web scraping.

Doesn't even have a build script, that's how prototyp-y it was.


Requires a vm arg adding the library path for the lwjgl native libraries

Something like

-Djava.library.path="D:\libs\lwjgl\native"
